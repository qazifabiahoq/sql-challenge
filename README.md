Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Project
Introduction
In this project, I am investigating the Pewlett Hackard Employee Database using pgAdmin. My mission is to delve into the company's workforce during the 1980s and 1990s. The tasks involve designing tables, importing data, and conducting insightful data analysis.

Project Structure
EmployeeSQL
table.sql: Contains table schema for each CSV file, defining data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
query.sql: Explore this file for SQL queries answering questions about the employee data.
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Project Workflow
Data Modeling
Inspect the provided CSV files to understand the data structure.
Utilize a tool like QuickDBD to sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) representing table relationships.
Data Engineering
Create table schemas for each CSV file, ensuring correct data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Maintain the correct order of table creation to handle foreign keys appropriately.
Import CSV data into corresponding SQL tables, preserving data integrity.
Data Analysis
Perform SQL queries to answer questions about employee data, covering various aspects such as personal information, hiring details, and department associations.


Usage
Execute table.sql to create the required tables in your PostgreSQL database.

Import CSV data into the created tables for analysis.

Run queries from query.sql to extract valuable insights.
