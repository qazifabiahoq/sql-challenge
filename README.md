# Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Project

## Introduction
In this project, I am investigating the Pewlett Hackard Employee Database using pgAdmin. My mission is to delve into the company's workforce during the 1980s and 1990s. The tasks involve designing tables, importing data, and conducting insightful data analysis.

## Project Structure


### Data Modeling: 

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):View the image to understand the relationships between tables as depicted in the Entity Relationship Diagram. For this project I utilized a tool like QuickDBD to sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) representing table relationships.



### Data Engineering: 

EmployeeSQL:

table.sql: Contains table schema for each CSV file, defining data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

query.sql: Explore this file for SQL queries answering questions about the employee data.


Create table schemas for each CSV file, ensuring correct data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Maintain the correct order of table creation to handle foreign keys appropriately.
Import CSV data into corresponding SQL tables, preserving data integrity.


### Data Analysis
Perform SQL queries to answer questions about employee data, covering various aspects such as personal information, hiring details, and department associations.
